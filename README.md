# PreModernEDH

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

We are an **EDH (Commander) Magic: The Gathering** playgroup that has created a variant of EDH based on using cards released up to **2003** (including Mirrodin).

Currently, our idea is still in development, and for now, we are focusing only on the **budget version** of this new format.

## Available Folders

- ### Budget
  In the **Budget** folder, you will find the current rules for the budget version of the format.

- ### Utils
  In the **Utils** folder, you will currently find only a console software (developed by us) to check that all cards were released **before or in 2003**.

## Contribute

We gladly accept suggestions for future modifications and improvements. ðŸ’¡

Thank you,  
**Simone**
