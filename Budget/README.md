# Pre Modern EDH Budget Rule

## Commander

- The commander must have been released in **2003 or earlier**.  
  Scryfall filter: `(game:paper) year<=2003`

## Rules

- For all the rules below, the price of each card will be based on its **cheapest version** available at the time of purchase, not on the actual version bought by the player.

- Cards **MUST** be purchased with a minimum condition of "**Moderately Played**" and in **Italian or English**. This rule also applies when determining the price of the card.

- All cards, whether played or not, must be saved in an **Excel file** to automatically verify the validity of the deck. A template is provided in the cloud, and users should create their own copy and fill it out with their deck details. The template can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nTfLx_VWWme5sWmwpo2JTtDp_4Me4HwnJueBWRTUDpY/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

- The deck must consist only of cards released **up to 2003**, including Mirrodin.  
  Scryfall filter: `year <= 2003`

- The deck must consist of cards with a **single card price of up to €1.10**. The price is recorded and saved to the file at the time of purchase.

- The deck can contain a maximum of **3 bonus cards** with a price of up to **€1.50**. All other cards must adhere to the **€1.10** price limit.

- The **total cost** of the deck's cards must be a maximum of **€50.00**.

- After the initial purchase of the deck, additional cards can be added, but each card must be recorded in the **Excel file**, including the purchase date and the price of the cheapest version for historical tracking. The **Excel file** will automatically check compliance with all rules after every change.

- The **only rule that will NOT be checked** in the Excel file is the card's release year. For this purpose, a tool is available in the `../Utils/` folder to verify validity.

- The rules apply to all types of cards (including lands).

- The **commander** is the only card that can bypass the rules. It is not considered for rules regarding the individual card price nor for the deck's overall consistency.
